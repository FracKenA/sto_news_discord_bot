## Server Growth Recommendations

### When to Apply for Verification
- **At 76 servers**: Apply immediately when eligible
- **Before 100 servers**: Critical - unverified bots cannot exceed 100 servers

### Preparation Steps
1. **Monitor server count**: Track growth using Discord Developer Portal
2. **Prepare application**: Gather required information in advance
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure all features work correctly across multiple servers
4. **Document use cases**: Prepare clear descriptions of bot functionality

## Verification Application Information

When applying for verification, use this information:

### **Bot Description**
```
STOBot is a specialized Discord bot that provides automated Star Trek Online news updates to gaming communities. It fetches official news from Arc Games API and delivers filtered content based on gaming platforms (PC, Xbox, PlayStation) to registered Discord channels.

Key Features:
- Automated STO news delivery
- Platform-specific filtering
- Slash command interface
- Duplicate detection
- Admin-controlled channel registration
```

### **Bot Category**
- **Primary**: Gaming
- **Secondary**: News & Information

### **Target Audience**
- Star Trek Online players and gaming communities
- Discord servers focused on STO content
- Gaming guilds and clans

### **Data Usage Justification**
```
STOBot collects minimal data required for functionality:
- Channel IDs: To deliver news to registered channels
- Platform preferences: To filter relevant news content
- Posted news tracking: To prevent duplicate content

No personal user data is collected or stored. All data is processed locally and not shared with third parties.
```

## Verification Timeline

### **Typical Timeline**
- **Application**: 1-2 weeks for initial review
- **Review Process**: 2-4 weeks for thorough evaluation
- **Response**: Discord will approve, request changes, or deny

### **Potential Delays**
- Incomplete applications
- Missing required documentation
- Policy violations or quality issues
- High application volume periods

## Post-Verification Considerations

### **Ongoing Compliance**
- Maintain privacy policy and terms of service
- Continue following Discord Developer Policy
- Keep bot updated and secure
- Monitor for policy changes

### **Growth Management**
- Consider sharding at 1000+ servers (if needed)
- Monitor performance and resource usage
- Plan for increased support requests

### **Feature Development**
- Avoid making major changes during verification review
- Document any significant updates
- Ensure new features maintain compliance

## Sharding Considerations

### **Current Status**: No sharding required
- Bot is designed for single-instance operation
- SQLite database handles current scale efficiently
- Horizontal scaling not yet necessary

### **When to Consider Sharding**
- **1000+ servers**: Discord recommends considering sharding
- **Performance issues**: If response times increase significantly
- **Resource constraints**: If single instance becomes inadequate

### **Sharding Strategy** (Future)
If sharding becomes necessary:
1. **Database**: Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for multi-instance support
2. **Architecture**: Implement shard-aware news distribution
3. **Coordination**: Add shard coordination for duplicate prevention

## Support and Monitoring

### **Pre-Verification**
- Monitor application status in Discord Developer Portal
- Respond promptly to any Discord team requests
- Maintain high uptime and reliability

### **During Review**
- Avoid major code changes
- Monitor for any service disruptions
- Be prepared to answer questions about bot functionality

### **Post-Verification**
- Continue monitoring performance metrics
- Maintain compliance with all policies
- Plan for potential growth scenarios
